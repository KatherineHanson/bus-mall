## Marketing Research Team
* Alice: Bianca is a forty-five year-old Product Manager looking for user interface data to improve her company's business logic, so they know what kinds of products to introduce more of. Bianca is especially interested in how many clicks each product gets. Additionally, how many clicks lead to purchases for a product? (Outside the scope of this project.)
* Bianca: Alice gathers all user click data to present to Bianca. She is a programming/data analytics ace and is confident that she can parse any table in any language. She doesn't love needing to look at the front-end to gather her data, but it's what Bianca wants and she's fine with it as long as it's neatly organized. Organized presentation of data is her priority.
* Claire: Claire is the marketing intern who helps out Bianca. She doesn't know how to parse data in the backend, so she doesn't share Bianca's frustration. She doesn't know technical terms at all, so she needs to be able to read the data without that expertise. Her priority is being able to understand all of the front end output without understanding tech-speak.
* Diana: Diana implements the company's actual marketing - social media, more tradition advertising - and frequently meets with Alice to discuss Alice's team's findings. Alice doesn't know much about data, just wants clear-cut recommendations on what users want. As long as the data returns what users are choosing with no glitches so Alice can translate it to her, she is happy.
